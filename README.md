## Contributing to eConsult website

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

Regarding Pull Requests to this project, always submit a PR against an "Accepted Issue" assigned to you. If an issue doesn't exist, please raise one first and wait for it to get accepted, and assigned. PRs without having accepted issues mentioned will be closed. The only exception to this rule are for PRs that address critical bug fixes that cannot wait for a maintainer's approval.

Two kinds of issues can be raised in this project:

1. Bug report
2. Feature Request

### Process Flow

- When a new issue is created, "Status: Review Needed" and "Type:Bug or Type:Enhancement" label is automatically added to it.
- Mods periodically check "Status:Review Needed" and add appropriate Priority and Status labels. If the issue is clear, set the status label as "Label: Available"
- People looking to contribute, filter issues by ["Status:Available"](https://github.com/covid19india/econsult-website/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Status%3A+Available%22) and comment on the issue that they would like to be assigned to work on it.
- Mods change the status label to "Status:Accepted" and assign the issue to the contributor.
- Contributor change the label to "Status: In Progress" and finally submit the pull request.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
